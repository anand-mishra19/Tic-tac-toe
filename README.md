# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game

A fun and interactive browser-based **Tic Tac Toe** game built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no libraries! This project is perfect for beginners looking to understand basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic in JavaScript.

## 🧠 Game Rules

* The game is played on a 3×3 grid.
* Player 1 is **"X"** and Player 2 is **"O"**.
* Players take turns marking empty cells.
* The first player to align 3 of their marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
* If all 9 squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## ✨ Features

* Two-player mode on the same device
* Responsive layout — works on desktop and mobile
* Highlighting the winning combination
* Option to restart/reset the game
* Simple and clean UI

## 💡 Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure and layout
* **CSS3** – Styling and responsiveness
* **JavaScript** – Game logic and interactivity
